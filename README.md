# Hack Reactor: EXT JavaScript Workshop

Welcome to Hack Reactor's EXT JavaScript Workshop. You're here to solidify your understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts. In today's session we'll be covering the following topics:

- Part I: Functions
- Part II: Array Iteration
- Part III: Objects

Each section consists of a lecture followed by a set of self-guided exercises. The self-guided exercises can be found in each section's respective folder in this repository. Before getting started, make sure that you have a JavaScript console open (like <a href="http://www.repl.it/languages/javascript" target="_blank">repl.it</a>), so you can complete all of the exercises.
